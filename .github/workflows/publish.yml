# This workflow automatically publishes the package to NPM when a new release is created.
# Before, creating a new release, make sure to update the package version in package.json
# and add a Granular Access Token (with read and write packages scope)
# to the repository secrets with the name NPM_TOKEN.
# Once, the release has been published remove it from the repository secrets.
