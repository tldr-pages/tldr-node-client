# tldr-node-client

A `Node.js` based command-line client for [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr).

## Installing

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/tldr.png)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/tldr)

```bash
$ npm install -g tldr
```

*Note: TLDR is still in early versions.
We try to minimise breaking changes, but if you run into issues
please try to download the latest package again.*

## Usage

To see tldr pages:

- `tldr <command>` show examples for this command
- `tldr --list` show all available pages
- `tldr --random` show a page at random
- `tldr --random-example` show a single random example

The client caches a copy of all pages locally, in `~/.tldr`.
There are more commands to control the local cache:

- `tldr --update` download the latest pages
- `tldr --clear-cache` delete the entire local cache

As a contributor, you might also need the following commands:

- `tldr --render <path>` render a local page for testing purposes

## Configuration

You can configure the `tldr` client by adding a `.tldrrc` file in your HOME directory.
This file has to be valid JSON:

```json
{
  "colors": {
    "text": "green",
    "command-background": "black",
    "command-foreground": "red",
    "command-token": "white"
  }
}
```

As a contributor, you can also point to your own fork or branch:

```js
{
  "repository" : "myfork/tldr",
  // or
  "repository" : "myfork/tldr#mybranch",  
}
```

## Windows Users

`tldr` can also run on Windows machines that have either [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) or [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

It doesn't work on the regular command line neither on PowerShell yet.
